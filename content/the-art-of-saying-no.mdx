Over the years, I have encountered a common piece of adviceâ€”learning to say "no". Now I'm asking myself why a request should change my focus.

I don't want to simply become adept at saying no; I want to understand the motivations behind my decisions.

My aim is to produce mindful, technical work that reflects my values and resonates with purpose. This requires a conscious effort to filter out any unnecessary commitments and distractions, enabling me to focus on projects that truly matter.

Saying "no" isn't about restriction but _liberation_. It allows me to set boundaries, protect my time and ideas, ensuring that I have the mental capacity to invest in the important things.

Having numerous opportunities is wonderful, and I will always be grateful for them. However, without clear reasonings it does not necessarily equal abundance.

Not a restricting rule but rather a guiding principle, beginning a better 26th year ahead.
