Quick notes on Git for reference.

1. <code>git maintenance start</code> – This command starts maintenance on a specific repository, optimising
   Git repository data and speeding up other Git commands.
2. <code>git config -g branch.sort -committerdate</code> – I never liked that git branches are not sorted
   by the last commit time first. This fixes that issue.
3. <code>git config -g column.ui auto</code> – Git branches are laid out in a list by default. I prefer
   them to be displayed in columns graphically.
4. <code>git push --force-with-lease</code> – This is safer than <code>--force</code>. It won't
   overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits were added by another coworker. This
   helps prevent accidentally overwriting someone else's work by force pushing.
