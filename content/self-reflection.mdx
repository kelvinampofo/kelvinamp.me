I recently came across the concept of <Link href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai'>Ikigai</Link>, a Japanese philosophy referring to something that gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. It involves finding the intersection between what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.

<br />

This got me thinking about how I can use this philosophy to re-think my approach to work and personal life.

<br />

At the start of this year my mantra was to be curious, read widely and try new things of interests. Software development, design, <Link href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction'>HCI</Link> and architecture. These are all areas which peak my curiosity, it makes me want to drop everything and be meticulous about my craft as an engineer.

<br />

By immersing myself in these domains, I can find my own unique path and create a life that allows me the freedom to express creativity and provide impact to what I believe the world needs.

<br />

Building this website was a good starting point. Personal websites are an opportunity to describe yourself, over-engineer to your hearts content, showcase your craft, and write down your thoughts. I want mine to reflect who I am, what I'm passionate about, and what I'm currently building.

<br />

My goal was to build a place that feels like home on the internet. I'll keep iterating over this. You can find the source code <Link href='https://github.com/kelvinampofo/kelvinamp.me'>here</Link> if interested.

<br />

Anyways, these are just some late night thoughts&mdash;will look to explore these ideas further.
