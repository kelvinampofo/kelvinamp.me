        I recently came across the concept of{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">ikigai</a> a Japanese
        philosophy referring to something that gives a person a sense of
        purpose, a reason for being. It involves finding the intersection
        between what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and
        what you can be paid for.
      </p>
      <p>
        This got me thinking about how I can use this philosophy to refactor my
        approach to work and personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of this year my mantra was to be curious, read widely and
        try new things. Guiltlessly exploring software development, design,{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">
          HCI
        </a>
        , architecture and other interests. It makes me want to drop everything
        and be meticulous about my craft as an engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        By immersing myself in these domains, I can find my own unique path and
        create a life that provides economic mobility, creativity, and impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        All I want to do is{" "}
        <q>
          <em>
            <a href="https://putsomethingback.stevejobsarchive.com/internal-meeting-at-apple">
              make something wonderful and put it out there
            </a>
          </em>
        </q>
        .

      <p>
        Building this website was a good starting point. Personal websites are
        an opportunity to describe yourself, showcase your craft, over-engineer
        and write. I want mine to reflect who I am, what I’m passionate about,
        and what I’m currently building.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal was to build a place that feels like a home on the internet.
        I’ll keep iterating over this. You can find the source code{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/kelvinampofo/kelvinamp.me">here</a> if
        interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, these are just some late night thoughts&mdash;I’ll look to
        explore these ideas further.
