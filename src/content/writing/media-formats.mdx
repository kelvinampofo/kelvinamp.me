# On Media Formats

Some notes on media formats. Recommended watch: [Explore media formats for the web](https://youtu.be/qB9L-ZYM1_0?si=ZRq60cGJWnDxZFxX).

## GIF

- 8 bits per pixel (256 colours), huge file sizes.
- good for memes, bad for actual image quality&mdash;avoid for anything longer than a few seconds

## JPEG

- lossy compression, great for photos
- no transparency support&mdash;supports progressive loading

## PNG

- lossless with alpha channel
- best for UI elements, not efficient for photo-like images

## WebP

- supports animation, transparency, and both lossy and lossless compression
  - lossy: [~25-34%](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study) smaller than JPEG
  - lossless: [~26%](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_alpha_study#results) smaller than PNG
- better than GIF, PNG, and JPEG in most cases&mdash;ideal for the modern web; ensure fallback for older Safari versions (< 14)

## AVIF

- newer format built on AV1 codec to achieve a high compression rate with no sacrifice to video quality
- smaller than JPEG/WebP, supports up to 12 bits colour depth, HDR, and animation
- should be the default if supported, though decoding can be CPU-intensive on some platforms

## JPEG XL

- designed to replace JPEG, with both lossy and lossless support
- discontinued or disabled support (e.g., Chrome)

## HEIC

- Appleâ€™s format for iOS photos
- great compression, Live Photo support, depth data&mdash;not safe for the web, convert to WebP or AVIF first
- use the HTML `&lt;picture&gt;` element to specify fallbacks, allowing the browser to choose a supported format from top to bottom.

  ```html
  <picture>
    <source srcset="image.heic" type="image/heic" />
    <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="descriptive text" />
  </picture>
  ```
</aside>

## General Guidelines

- prefer AVIF -> WebP -> JPEG/PNG
- for UI assets: SVG > PNG
- avoid GIF unless essential
- use WebP or video formats for animations
- for [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview): use HEIC for hardware acceleration
- always serve the smallest viable file
