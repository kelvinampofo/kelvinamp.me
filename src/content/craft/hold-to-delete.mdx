# Hold to Delete

Uses `clip-path` to animate the progress—leveraging [hardware acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration) for a more efficient interaction.

My favourite detail is the Safari `theme-colour` tint that responds to user action, driven by a script interpolating colour stops for a smooth animation.
