# Adaptive interface

An adaptive interface based on usage. Inspired by this [tweet](https://x.com/carmguti/status/1877132625388716124) on
game design.

I was discussing a use case for this type of interface with a friend: what if the visual cues that help users learn keyboard shortcuts gradually disappeared after being used a specific number of times, encouraging recall through repetition? They reappear when accessed again via the graphical user interface, reinforcing learning through use. In essence, it would act as a form of behavioural reinforcementâ€”keyboard training.
