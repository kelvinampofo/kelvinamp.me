# Timeline Picker

A timeline picker for navigating time-based or sequential data. A notable detail, often overlooked, is the increased hit area—improving the interface’s [affordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance). Simply an invisible `::after` pseudo-element with added padding for that one.
