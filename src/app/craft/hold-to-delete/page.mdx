# Hold to Delete

Uses `clip-path` to animate the progressâ€”leveraging [hardware acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration) for a more efficient interaction.

Inspired by [Pingdom's](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/247nb2/hold_to_delete_pingdoms_clever_alternative_to_the/?rdt=41624) implementation, this provides a delightful alternative to confirmation modals and dialogs.
