# Git notes

Quick notes for reference.

- `git maintenance start` – starts maintenance on a
  specific repository and speeds up other git commands by optimising repository
  data.
- `git config --global branch.sort -committerdate` – I never liked that git
  branches are not sorted by the last commit time first. This fixes the problem.
- `git config --global column.ui auto` – git branches are laid out in a
  list by default. I prefer them to be displayed in columns graphically.
- `git push --force-with-lease` – safer than
  `--force`.
  - aborts if the remote branch has moved, shielding teammates from _accidental_ overwrites.
- `git log -L &lt;start,end&gt;:&lt;file&gt;` – trace the history of just a slice of a file—ideal for watching how a function or block evolved.
- `git commit --fixup &lt;SHA&gt;` – prepare a helper commit that Git will auto‑squash during a rebase; perfect for tidying up changes after code‑review feedback.
