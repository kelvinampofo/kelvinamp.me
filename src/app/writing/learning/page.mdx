# Things I've learned

1. Find the intersection between what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. Whatever that is, do it often.
2. Friends enrich our lives like no others can.
3. Honestly, self-care is extremely important.
4. Aim for 10x, not 10%.
5. Drinking enough water is kind of hard.
6. Don't be apologetic for being yourself.
7. Design is all about developing taste.
8. Invite novelty by eliminating repetition.
9. <s>Minimalism</s> simplicity is the key.
10. "What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun." – Ecclesiastes 1:9 – In essence, everything is a remix of past work.
11. Time-blocking is not really my thing, calendar white space creates a buffer for work + play.
12. AI is just a tool; use it to enhance creative and technical work.
13. Think different.
14. Keep a log, note down the small details – they help remind you of the big details.
15. Make things with the time, space, and materials you have at present.
16. Don’t get stuck on perfection, prioritise speed of process and refinement through iteration and feedback.
17. Recreate the ideas and ethos of inspiring humans, within the context of my own life.
18. Growth ≠ linear.
19. Programming is just like art or playing an instrument. It takes time.
20. Sleep is priority.
