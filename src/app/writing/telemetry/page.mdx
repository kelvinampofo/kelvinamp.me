# Telemetry

In motor racing, race engineers sit trackside with headsets on, their eyes glued to telemetry dashboards that display critical data such as brake temperatures, tire degradation, and fuel mix. While they don't drive the car, their expertise ensures that it operates at peak performance. Similarly, in software, SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) and DevOps engineers monitor systems with tools that provide real-time insights into user experiences, acting as our pit wall dashboards.

The user session represents the drive, and the application is the vehicle. Frontend web vitals like TTFB (Time to First Byte), FCP (First Contentful Paint), and other metrics are akin to lap times, providing essential feedback on performance. Slow route transitions or broken UX can feel like understeer, indicating areas that need immediate attention.

As an engineer, I recognize that instrumentation is a core part of my craft in creating software. My commitment is to deliver exceptional user experiences that resonate with the viewer. This means that telemetry and frontend observability are integral to good design. We should measure not only how the interface looks but also how it performs under load, how it recovers from errors, and how fast it feels. Frontend observability allows us to understand user interactions deeply, ensuring that we can identify pain points and enhance overall satisfaction.

It’s not merely about chasing numbers; it’s about designing for real-world conditions. While taste and intuition are important, runtime data adds rigour, reliability, usability, and a humane touch to our designs.

Design shouldn’t fail when the system does; that’s when people need it the most.
