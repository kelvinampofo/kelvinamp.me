# Motion

I'm really enjoying macOS Sonoma so far. The updated interface of the lock screen and the smooth login transition enhances the overall usability and adds a touch of elegance to the operating system. For me, interaction design like this makes the human-computer interaction feel delightful.

Those seemingly small yet impactful micro-interactions, often go unnoticed but contribute significantly to the user experience. [Family](https://family.co/) and Apple is an example of companies that implements this well.

However, routine actions that are low in novelty should refrain from unnecessary animations. For instance, the right-click panel on macOS employs a subtle animation when closing, but opens instantly. On the other hand, actions that are less frequent, such as the login process, benefit from the addition of smooth motion&mdash;creating an organic experience.
