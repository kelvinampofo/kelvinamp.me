# On Media Formats

Some notes on media formats. Recommended watch: [Explore media formats for the web](https://youtu.be/qB9L-ZYM1_0?si=ZRq60cGJWnDxZFxX).

## Existing formats

### GIF

- 8 bits per pixel (256 colours), huge file sizes.
  - good for memes, bad for actual image quality&mdash;avoid for anything longer than a few seconds

## JPEG

- lossy compression, great for photos
- no transparency support&mdash;supports progressive loading

## PNG

- lossless with alpha transparency
- best for UI elements, not efficient for photo-like images

## Modern formats

### WebP

- supports animation, transparency, and compression
- better than GIF, PNG, and JPEG in most cases&mdash;ideal for the modern web though ensure fallback for older Safari versions (< 14)

## AVIF

- newer format built on AV1 codec to achieve high compression rate with no sacrifice to video quality
  - smaller than JPEG/WebP, supports up to 12 bits colour depth, HDR and animation&mdash;should be the default if supported, though decoding can be CPU-intensive on some platforms

## JPEG XL

- designed to replace JPEG
- supports lossless/lossy, still not widely supported&mdash;some browsers have discontinued or disabled support by default (e.g., Chrome)

## HEIC

- Apple’s format for iOS photos

  - great compression, Live Photo support, depth data&mdash;not safe for Web-convert to WebP or AVIF first
  - use the `&lt;picture&gt;` element with `&lt;source&gt;` fallbacks to serve HEIC where supported:

  ```html
  <picture>
    <source srcset="image.heic" type="image/heic" />
    <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="descriptive text" />
  </picture>
  ```

## General Guidelines

- prefer AVIF → WebP → JPEG/PNG
- for UI assets: SVG > PNG
- avoid GIF unless essential
- use WebP or video formats for animations
- if intending to use [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview)&mdash;use HEIC as it's [hardware accelerated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration)
- always serve the smallest viable file
